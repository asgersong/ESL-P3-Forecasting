# P3: Forecasting
Time series data is a ubiquitous type of data underlying many significant challenges, i.a. challenges within forecasting. Forecasting challenges include, predicting economies/share/stock prices by historical economy related data, predicting the weather by historical weather data and predicting disease progression by historical bio-marker and pathology data.

### Problem statement
The focus of this project is to design, implement, test, compare, and document a selection of forecasting algorithms, e.g. ARMA, ARIMA, SARIMA, SARIMAX, LSTM and Prophet. The algorithms must be optimized with regard to forecasting accuracy, simplicity and explain-ability/interpret-ability, i.e. results must be shown such that end-users readily can see the basis for the approximations. To quantify the quality of the algorithms, comparative evaluations should be carried out via objective metrics and the algorithms should be assessed against state of the art.
